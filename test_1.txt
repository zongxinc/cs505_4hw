<s> the family of dashwood had long been settled in sussex . </s>
<s> their estate was large , and their residence was at norland park , in the centre of their property , where , for many generations , they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance . </s>
<s> the late owner of this estate was a single man , who lived to a very advanced age , and who for many years of his life , had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister . </s>
<s> but her death , which happened ten years before his own , produced a great alteration in his home ; for to supply her loss , he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew mr. henry dashwood , the legal inheritor of the norland estate , and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it . </s>
<s> in the society of his nephew and niece , and their children , the old gentleman 's days were comfortably spent . </s>
<s> his attachment to them all increased . </s>
<s> the constant attention of mr. and mrs. henry dashwood to his wishes , which proceeded not merely from interest , but from goodness of heart , gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive ; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence . </s>
<s> by a former marriage , mr. henry dashwood had one son : by his present lady , three daughters . </s>
<s> the son , a steady respectable young man , was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother , which had been large , and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age . </s>
<s> by his own marriage , likewise , which happened soon afterwards , he added to his wealth . </s>
<s> to him therefore the succession to the norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters ; for their fortune , independent of what might arise to them from their father 's inheriting that property , could be but small . </s>
<s> their mother had nothing , and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal ; for the remaining moiety of his first wife 's fortune was also secured to her child , and he had only a life - interest in it . </s>
<s> the old gentleman died : his will was read , and like almost every other will , gave as much disappointment as pleasure . </s>
<s> he was neither so unjust , nor so ungrateful , as to leave his estate from his nephew ; but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest . </s>
<s> mr. dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son ; but to his son , and his son 's son , a child of four years old , it was secured , in such a way , as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him , and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate , or by any sale of its valuable woods . </s>
<s> the whole was tied up for the benefit of this child , who , in occasional visits with his father and mother at norland , had so far gained on the affections of his uncle , by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old ; an imperfect articulation , an earnest desire of having his own way , many cunning tricks , and a great deal of noise , as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which , for years , he had received from his niece and her daughters . </s>
<s> he meant not to be unkind , however , and , as a mark of his affection for the three girls , he left them a thousand pounds a - piece . </s>
<s> mr. dashwood 's disappointment was , at first , severe ; but his temper was cheerful and sanguine ; and he might reasonably hope to live many years , and by living economically , lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large , and capable of almost immediate improvement . </s>
<s> but the fortune , which had been so tardy in coming , was his only one twelvemonth . </s>
<s> he survived his uncle no longer ; and ten thousand pounds , including the late legacies , was all that remained for his widow and daughters . </s>
<s> his son was sent for as soon as his danger was known , and to him mr. dashwood recommended , with all the strength and urgency which illness could command , the interest of his mother - in - law and sisters . </s>
<s> mr. john dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family ; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at such a time , and he promised to do every thing in his power to make them comfortable . </s>
<s> his father was rendered easy by such an assurance , and mr. john dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them . </s>
<s> [ illustration : _ his son 's son , a child of four years old . _ ] </s>
<s> he was not an ill - disposed young man , unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill - disposed : but he was , in general , well respected ; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties . </s>
<s> had he married a more amiable woman , he might have been made still more respectable than he was : he might even have been made amiable himself ; for he was very young when he married , and very fond of his wife . </s>
<s> but mrs. john dashwood was a strong caricature of himself ; more narrow - minded and selfish . </s>
<s> when he gave his promise to his father , he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a - piece . </s>
<s> he then really thought himself equal to it . </s>
<s> the prospect of four thousand a - year , in addition to his present income , besides the remaining half of his own mother 's fortune , warmed his heart , and made him feel capable of generosity . </s>
<s> yes , he would give them three thousand pounds : it would be liberal and handsome ! </s>
<s> it would be enough to make them completely easy . </s>
<s> three thousand pounds ! </s>
<s> he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience . </s>
<s> he thought of it all day long , and for many days successively , and he did not repent . </s>
<s> no sooner was his father 's funeral over , than mrs. john dashwood , without sending any notice of her intention to her mother - in - law , arrived with her child and their attendants . </s>
<s> no one could dispute her right to come ; the house was her husband 's from the moment of his father 's decease ; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater , and to a woman in mrs. dashwood 's situation , with only common feelings , must have been highly unpleasing . </s>
<s> but in _ her _ mind there was a sense of honor so keen , a generosity so romantic , that any offence of the kind , by whomsoever given or received , was to her a source of immovable disgust . </s>
<s> mrs. john dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband 's family ; but she had had no opportunity , till the present , of showing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it . </s>
<s> so acutely did mrs. dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour , and so earnestly did she despise her daughter - in - law for it , that , on the arrival of the latter , she would have quitted the house for ever , had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going , and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay , and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother . </s>
<s> elinor , this eldest daughter , whose advice was so effectual , possessed a strength of understanding , and coolness of judgment , which qualified her , though only nineteen , to be the counsellor of her mother , and enabled her frequently to counteract , to the advantage of them all , that eagerness of mind in mrs. dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence . </s>
<s> she had an excellent heart ; her disposition was affectionate , and her feelings were strong ; but she knew how to govern them : it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn ; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught . </s>
<s> marianne 's abilities were , in many respects , quite equal to elinor 's . </s>
<s> she was sensible and clever ; but eager in everything : her sorrows , her joys , could have no moderation . </s>
<s> she was generous , amiable , interesting : she was everything but prudent . </s>
<s> the resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great . </s>
<s> elinor saw , with concern , the excess of her sister 's sensibility ; but by mrs. dashwood it was valued and cherished . </s>
<s> they encouraged each other now in the violence of their affliction . </s>
<s> the agony of grief which overpowered them at first , was voluntarily renewed , was sought for , was created again and again . </s>
<s> they gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow , seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it , and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future . </s>
<s> elinor , too , was deeply afflicted ; but still she could struggle , she could exert herself . </s>
<s> she could consult with her brother , could receive her sister - in - law on her arrival , and treat her with proper attention ; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion , and encourage her to similar forbearance . </s>
<s> margaret , the other sister , was a good - humored , well - disposed girl ; but as she had already imbibed a good deal of marianne 's romance , without having much of her sense , she did not , at thirteen , bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life . </s>
<s> mrs. john dashwood now installed herself mistress of norland ; and her mother and sisters - in - law were degraded to the condition of visitors . </s>
<s> as such , however , they were treated by her with quiet civility ; and by her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody beyond himself , his wife , and their child . </s>
<s> he really pressed them , with some earnestness , to consider norland as their home ; and , as no plan appeared so eligible to mrs. dashwood as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood , his invitation was accepted . </s>
<s> a continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight , was exactly what suited her mind . </s>
<s> in seasons of cheerfulness , no temper could be more cheerful than hers , or possess , in a greater degree , that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself . </s>
<s> but in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy , and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy . </s>
<s> mrs. john dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters . </s>
<s> to take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree . </s>
<s> she begged him to think again on the subject . </s>
<s> how could he answer it to himself to rob his child , and his only child too , of so large a sum ? </s>
<s> and what possible claim could the miss dashwoods , who were related to him only by half blood , which she considered as no relationship at all , have on his generosity to so large an amount . </s>
<s> it was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist between the children of any man by different marriages ; and why was he to ruin himself , and their poor little harry , by giving away all his money to his half sisters ? </s>
<s> " it was my father 's last request to me , " replied her husband , " that i should assist his widow and daughters . " </s>
<s> " he did not know what he was talking of , i dare say ; ten to one </s>
<s> but he was light - headed at the time . </s>
<s> had he been in his right senses , he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child . " </s>
<s> " he did not stipulate for any particular sum , my dear fanny ; he only requested me , in general terms , to assist them , and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do . </s>
<s> perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself . </s>
<s> he could hardly suppose i should neglect them . </s>
<s> but as he required the promise , i could not do less than give it ; at least i thought so at the time . </s>
<s> the promise , therefore , was given , and must be performed . </s>
<s> something must be done for them whenever they leave norland and settle in a new home . " </s>
<s> " well , then , _ let _ something be done for them ; but _ that _ something need not be three thousand pounds . </s>
<s> consider , " she added , " that when the money is once parted with , it never can return . </s>
<s> your sisters will marry , and it will be gone for ever . </s>
<s> if , indeed , it could be restored to our poor little boy-- " </s>
<s> " why , to be sure , " said her husband , very gravely , " that would make great difference . </s>
<s> the time may come when harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with . </s>
<s> if he should have a numerous family , for instance , it would be a very convenient addition . " </s>
<s> " to be sure it would . " </s>
<s> " perhaps , then , it would be better for all parties , if the sum were diminished one half . </s>
<s> five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes ! " </s>
<s> " oh ! beyond anything great ! </s>
<s> what brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters , even if _ really _ his sisters ! </s>
<s> and as it is -- only half blood ! </s>
<s> but you have such a generous spirit ! " </s>
<s> " i would not wish to do any thing mean , " he replied . </s>
<s> " one had rather , on such occasions , do too much than too little . </s>
<s> no one , at least , can think i have not done enough for them : even themselves , they can hardly expect more . " </s>
<s> " there is no knowing what _ they _ may expect , " said the lady , " but we are not to think of their expectations : the question is , what you can afford to do . " </s>
<s> " certainly ; and i think i may afford to give them five hundred pounds a - piece . </s>
<s> as it is , without any addition of mine , they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother 's death -- a very comfortable fortune for any young woman . " </s>
<s> " to be sure it is ; and , indeed , it strikes me that they can want no addition at all . </s>
<s> they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them . </s>
<s> if they marry , they will be sure of doing well , and if they do not , they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds . " </s>
<s> " that is very true , and , therefore , i do not know whether , upon the whole , it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives , rather than for them -- something of the annuity kind i mean . </s>
<s> my sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself . </s>
<s> a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable . " </s>
<s> his wife hesitated a little , however , in giving her consent to this plan . </s>
<s> " to be sure , " said she , " it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once . </s>
<s> but , then , if mrs. dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in . " </s>
<s> " fifteen years ! </s>
<s> my dear fanny ; her life can not be worth half that purchase . " </s>
<s> " certainly not ; but if you observe , people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them ; and she is very stout and healthy , and hardly forty . </s>
<s> an annuity is a very serious business ; it comes over and over every year , and there is no getting rid of it . </s>
<s> you are not aware of what you are doing . </s>
<s> i have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities ; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father 's will , and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it . </s>
<s> twice every year these annuities were to be paid ; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them ; and then one of them was said to have died , and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing . </s>
<s> my mother was quite sick of it . </s>
<s> her income was not her own , she said , with such perpetual claims on it ; and it was the more unkind in my father , because , otherwise , the money would have been entirely at my mother 's disposal , without any restriction whatever . </s>
<s> it has given me such an abhorrence of annuities , that i am sure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world . " </s>
<s> " it is certainly an unpleasant thing , " replied mr. dashwood , " to have those kind of yearly drains on one 's income . </s>
<s> one 's fortune , as your mother justly says , is _ not _ one 's own . </s>
<s> to be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum , on every rent day , is by no means desirable : it takes away one 's independence . " </s>
<s> " undoubtedly ; and after all you have no thanks for it . </s>
<s> they think themselves secure , you do no more than what is expected , and it raises no gratitude at all . </s>
<s> if i were you , whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely . </s>
<s> i would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly . </s>
<s> it may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred , or even fifty pounds from our own expenses . " </s>
<s> " i believe you are right , my love ; it will be better that there should be no annuity in the case ; whatever i may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance , because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income , and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year . </s>
<s> it will certainly be much the best way . </s>
<s> a present of fifty pounds , now and then , will prevent their ever being distressed for money , and will , i think , be amply discharging my promise to my father . " </s>
<s> " to be sure it will . </s>
<s> indeed , to say the truth , i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all . </s>
<s> the assistance he thought of , i dare say , was only such as might be reasonably expected of you ; for instance , such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them , helping them to move their things , and sending them presents of fish and game , and so forth , whenever they are in season . </s>
<s> i 'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther ; indeed , it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did . </s>
<s> do but consider , my dear mr. dashwood , how excessively comfortable your mother - in - law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds , besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls , which brings them in fifty pounds a year a - piece , and , of course , they will pay their mother for their board out of it . </s>
<s> altogether , they will have five hundred a - year amongst them , and what on earth can four women want for more than that?--they will live so cheap ! </s>
<s> their housekeeping will be nothing at all . </s>
<s> they will have no carriage , no horses , and hardly any servants ; they will keep no company , and can have no expenses of any kind ! </s>
<s> only conceive how comfortable they will be ! </s>
<s> five hundred a year ! </s>
<s> i am sure i can not imagine how they will spend half of it ; and as to your giving them more , it is quite absurd to think of it . </s>
<s> they will be much more able to give _ you _ something . " </s>
<s> " upon my word , " said mr. dashwood , " i believe you are perfectly right . </s>
<s> my father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say . </s>
<s> i clearly understand it now , and i will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described . </s>
<s> when my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as i can . </s>
<s> some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then . " </s>
<s> " certainly , " returned mrs. john dashwood . </s>
<s> " but , however , _ one _ thing must be considered . </s>
<s> when your father and mother moved to norland , though the furniture of stanhill was sold , all the china , plate , and linen was saved , and is now left to your mother . </s>
<s> her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it . " </s>
<s> " that is a material consideration undoubtedly . </s>
<s> a valuable legacy indeed ! </s>
<s> and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here . " </s>
<s> " yes ; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house . </s>
<s> a great deal too handsome , in my opinion , for any place _ they _ can ever afford to live in . </s>
<s> but , however , so it is . </s>
<s> your father thought only of _ them _ </s>
<s> and i must say this : that you owe no particular gratitude to him , nor attention to his wishes ; for we very well know that if he could , he would have left almost everything in the world to _ them . _ " </s>
<s> this argument was irresistible . </s>
<s> it gave to his intentions whatever of decision was wanting before ; and he finally resolved , that it would be absolutely unnecessary , if not highly indecorous , to do more for the widow and children of his father , than such kind of neighbourly acts as his own wife pointed out . </s>
<s> mrs. dashwood remained at norland several months ; not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while ; for when her spirits began to revive , and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances , she was impatient to be gone , and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of norland ; for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible . </s>
<s> but she could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease , and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter , whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income , which her mother would have approved . </s>
<s> [ illustration : " _ i can not imagine how they will spend half of it . _ " ] </s>
<s> mrs. dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour , which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections . </s>
<s> she doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he had doubted it himself , and she thought of it for her daughters ' sake with satisfaction , though as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000l would support her in affluence . </s>
<s> for their brother 's sake , too , for the sake of his own heart , she rejoiced ; and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before , in believing him incapable of generosity . </s>
<s> his attentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare was dear to him , and , for a long time , she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions . </s>
<s> the contempt which she had , very early in their acquaintance , felt for her daughter - in - law , was very much increased by the farther knowledge of her character , which half a year 's residence in her family afforded ; and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former , the two ladies might have found it impossible to have lived together so long , had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility , according to the opinions of mrs. dashwood , to her daughters ' continuance at norland . </s>
<s> this circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of mrs. john dashwood , a gentlemanlike and pleasing young man , who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister 's establishment at norland , and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there . </s>
<s> some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of interest , for edward ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died very rich ; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence , for , except a trifling sum , the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother . </s>
<s> but mrs. dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration . </s>
<s> it was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable , that he loved her daughter , and that elinor returned the partiality . </s>
<s> it was contrary to every doctrine of her 's that difference of fortune should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition ; and that elinor 's merit should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her , was to her comprehension impossible . </s>
<s> edward ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address . </s>
<s> he was not handsome , and his manners required intimacy to make them pleasing . </s>
<s> he was too diffident to do justice to himself ; but when his natural shyness was overcome , his behaviour gave every indication of an open , affectionate heart . </s>
<s> his understanding was good , and his education had given it solid improvement . </s>
<s> but he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister , who longed to see him distinguished as -- they hardly knew what . </s>
<s> they wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some manner or other . </s>
<s> his mother wished to interest him in political concerns , to get him into parliament , or to see him connected with some of the great men of the day . </s>
<s> mrs. john dashwood wished it likewise ; but in the mean while , till one of these superior blessings could be attained , it would have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche . </s>
<s> but edward had no turn for great men or barouches . </s>
<s> all his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet of private life . </s>
<s> fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising . </s>
<s> edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged much of mrs. dashwood 's attention ; for she was , at that time , in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects . </s>
<s> she saw only that he was quiet and unobtrusive , and she liked him for it . </s>
<s> he did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill - timed conversation . </s>
<s> she was first called to observe and approve him farther , by a reflection which elinor chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister . </s>
<s> it was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her mother . </s>
<s> " it is enough , " said she ; " to say that he is unlike fanny is enough . </s>
<s> it implies everything amiable . </s>
<s> i love him already . " </s>
<s> " i think you will like him , " said elinor , " when you know more of him . " </s>
<s> " like him ! " replied her mother with a smile . </s>
<s> i feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love . " </s>
<s> " you may esteem him . " </s>
<s> i have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love . " </s>
<s> mrs. dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him . </s>
<s> her manners were attaching , and soon banished his reserve . </s>
<s> she speedily comprehended all his merits ; the persuasion of his regard for elinor perhaps assisted her penetration ; but she really felt assured of his worth : and even that quietness of manner , which militated against all her established ideas of what a young man 's address ought to be , was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper affectionate . </s>
<s> no sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to elinor , than she considered their serious attachment as certain , and looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching . </s>
<s> " in a few months , my dear marianne , " said she , " elinor will , in all probability be settled for life . </s>
<s> we shall miss her ; but _ she _ will be happy . " </s>
<s> " oh ! </s>
<s> mamma , how shall we do without her ? " </s>
<s> " my love , it will be scarcely a separation . </s>
<s> we shall live within a few miles of each other , and shall meet every day of our lives . </s>
<s> you will gain a brother -- a real , affectionate brother . </s>
<s> i have the highest opinion in the world of edward 's heart . </s>
<s> but you look grave , marianne ; do you disapprove your sister 's choice ? " </s>
<s> " perhaps , " said marianne , " i may consider it with some surprise . </s>
<s> edward is very amiable , and i love him tenderly . </s>
<s> but yet -- he is not the kind of young man ; there is something wanting -- his figure is not striking ; it has none of that grace which i should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister . </s>
<s> his eyes want all that spirit , that fire , which at once announce virtue and intelligence . </s>
<s> and besides all this , i am afraid , mamma , he has no real taste . </s>
<s> music seems scarcely to attract him , and though he admires elinor 's drawings very much , it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth . </s>
<s> it is evident , in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws , that in fact he knows nothing of the matter . </s>
<s> he admires as a lover , not as a connoisseur . </s>
<s> to satisfy me , those characters must be united . </s>
<s> i could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own . </s>
<s> he must enter into all my feelings ; the same books , the same music must charm us both . </s>
<s> oh ! mama , how spiritless , how tame was edward 's manner in reading to us last night ! </s>
<s> i felt for my sister most severely . </s>
<s> yet she bore it with so much composure , she seemed scarcely to notice it . </s>
<s> i could hardly keep my seat . </s>
<s> to hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild , pronounced with such impenetrable calmness , such dreadful indifference ! " </s>
<s> " he would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose . </s>
<s> i thought so at the time ; but you _ would _ give him cowper . " </s>
<s> " nay , mamma , if he is not to be animated by cowper!--but we must allow for difference of taste . </s>
<s> elinor has not my feelings , and therefore she may overlook it , and be happy with him . </s>
<s> but it would have broke _ my _ heart , had i loved him , to hear him read with so little sensibility . </s>
<s> mama , the more i know of the world , the more am i convinced that i shall never see a man whom i can really love . </s>
<s> i require so much ! </s>
<s> he must have all edward 's virtues , and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm . " </s>
<s> " remember , my love , that you are not seventeen . </s>
<s> it is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness . </s>
<s> why should you be less fortunate than your mother ? </s>
<s> in one circumstance only , my marianne , may your destiny be different from her 's ! " </s>
<s> " what a pity it is , elinor , " said marianne , " that edward should have no taste for drawing . " </s>
<s> " no taste for drawing ! " replied elinor , " why should you think so ? </s>
<s> he does not draw himself , indeed , but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people , and i assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste , though he has not had opportunities of improving it . </s>
<s> had he ever been in the way of learning , i think he would have drawn very well . </s>
<s> he distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much , that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture ; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste , which in general direct him perfectly right . " </s>
<s> marianne was afraid of offending , and said no more on the subject ; but the kind of approbation which elinor described as excited in him by the drawings of other people , was very far from that rapturous delight , which , in her opinion , could alone be called taste . </s>
<s> yet , though smiling within herself at the mistake , she honoured her sister for that blind partiality to edward which produced it . </s>
<s> " i hope , marianne , " continued elinor , " you do not consider him as deficient in general taste . </s>
<s> indeed , i think i may say that you can not , for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial , and if _ that _ were your opinion , i am sure you could never be civil to him . " </s>
<s> marianne hardly knew what to say . </s>
<s> she would not wound the feelings of her sister on any account , and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible . </s>
<s> at length she replied : </s>
<s> " do not be offended , elinor , if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits . </s>
<s> i have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind , his inclinations and tastes , as you have ; but i have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense . </s>
<s> i think him every thing that is worthy and amiable . " </s>
<s> " i am sure , " replied elinor , with a smile , " that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that . </s>
<s> i do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly . " </s>
<s> marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased . </s>
<s> " of his sense and his goodness , " continued elinor , " no one can , i think , be in doubt , who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation . </s>
<s> the excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent . </s>
<s> you know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth . </s>
<s> but of his minuter propensities , as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself . </s>
<s> he and i have been at times thrown a good deal together , while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother . </s>
<s> i have seen a great deal of him , have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste ; and , upon the whole , i venture to pronounce that his mind is well - informed , enjoyment of books exceedingly great , his imagination lively , his observation just and correct , and his taste delicate and pure . </s>
<s> his abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person . </s>
<s> at first sight , his address is certainly not striking ; and his person can hardly be called handsome , till the expression of his eyes , which are uncommonly good , and the general sweetness of his countenance , is perceived . </s>
<s> at present , i know him so well , that i think him really handsome ; or at least , almost so . </s>
<s> what say you , marianne ? " </s>
<s> " i shall very soon think him handsome , elinor , if i do not now . </s>
<s> when you tell me to love him as a brother , i shall no more see imperfection in his face , than i now do in his heart . " </s>
<s> elinor started at this declaration , and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into , in speaking of him . </s>
<s> she felt that edward stood very high in her opinion . </s>
<s> she believed the regard to be mutual ; but she required greater certainty of it to make marianne 's conviction of their attachment agreeable to her . </s>
<s> she knew that what marianne and her mother conjectured one moment , they believed the next -- that with them , to wish was to hope , and to hope was to expect . </s>
<s> she tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister . </s>
<s> " i do not attempt to deny , " said she , " that i think very highly of him -- that i greatly esteem , that i like him . " </s>
<s> marianne here burst forth with indignation-- </s>
<s> " esteem him ! </s>
<s> like him ! </s>
<s> cold - hearted elinor ! </s>
<s> oh ! worse than cold - hearted ! </s>
<s> ashamed of being otherwise . </s>
<s> use those words again , and i will leave the room this moment . " </s>
<s> elinor could not help laughing . </s>
<s> " excuse me , " said she ; " and be assured that i meant no offence to you , by speaking , in so quiet a way , of my own feelings . </s>
<s> believe them to be stronger than i have declared ; believe them , in short , to be such as his merit , and the suspicion -- the hope -- of his affection for me may warrant , without imprudence or folly . </s>
<s> but farther than this you must not believe . </s>
<s> i am by no means assured of his regard for me . </s>
<s> there are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful ; and till his sentiments are fully known , you can not wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality , by believing or calling it more than it is . </s>
<s> in my heart i feel little -- scarcely any doubt of his preference . </s>
<s> but there are other points to be considered besides his inclination . </s>
<s> he is very far from being independent . </s>
<s> what his mother really is we can not know ; but , from fanny 's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and i am very much mistaken if edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank . " </s>
<s> marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth . </s>
<s> " and you really are not engaged to him ! " said she . </s>
<s> " yet it certainly soon will happen . </s>
<s> but two advantages will proceed from this delay . </s>
<s> i shall not lose you so soon , and edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity . </s>
<s> oh ! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself , how delightful it would be ! " </s>
<s> elinor had given her real opinion to her sister . </s>
<s> she could not consider her partiality for edward in so prosperous a state as marianne had believed it . </s>
<s> there was , at times , a want of spirits about him which , if it did not denote indifference , spoke of something almost as unpromising . </s>
<s> a doubt of her regard , supposing him to feel it , need not give him more than inquietude . </s>
<s> it would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him . </s>
<s> a more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection . </s>
<s> she knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present , nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself , without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement . </s>
<s> with such a knowledge as this , it was impossible for elinor to feel easy on the subject . </s>
<s> she was far from depending on that result of his preference of her , which her mother and sister still considered as certain . </s>
<s> nay , the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard ; and sometimes , for a few painful minutes , she believed it to be no more than friendship . </s>
<s> but , whatever might really be its limits , it was enough , when perceived by his sister , to make her uneasy , and at the same time , ( which was still more common , ) to make her uncivil . </s>
<s> she took the first opportunity of affronting her mother - in - law on the occasion , talking to her so expressively of her brother 's great expectations , of mrs. ferrars 's resolution that both her sons should marry well , and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to _ draw him in _ , that mrs. dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious , nor endeavor to be calm . </s>
<s> she gave her an answer which marked her contempt , and instantly left the room , resolving that , whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal , her beloved elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations . </s>
<s> in this state of her spirits , a letter was delivered to her from the post , which contained a proposal particularly well timed . </s>
<s> it was the offer of a small house , on very easy terms , belonging to a relation of her own , a gentleman of consequence and property in devonshire . </s>
<s> the letter was from this gentleman himself , and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation . </s>
<s> he understood that she was in need of a dwelling ; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage , he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary , if the situation pleased her . </s>
<s> he earnestly pressed her , after giving the particulars of the house and garden , to come with her daughters to barton park , the place of his own residence , from whence she might judge , herself , whether barton cottage , for the houses were in the same parish , could , by any alteration , be made comfortable to her . </s>
<s> he seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin ; more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections . </s>
<s> she needed no time for deliberation or inquiry . </s>
<s> her resolution was formed as she read . </s>
<s> the situation of barton , in a county so far distant from sussex as devonshire , which , but a few hours before , would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place , was now its first recommendation . </s>
<s> to quit the neighbourhood of norland was no longer an evil ; it was an object of desire ; it was a blessing , in comparison of the misery of continuing her daughter - in - law 's guest ; and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress . </s>
<s> she instantly wrote sir john middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness , and her acceptance of his proposal ; and then hastened to show both letters to her daughters , that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent . </s>
<s> elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from norland , than immediately amongst their present acquaintance . </s>
<s> on _ that _ head , therefore , it was not for her to oppose her mother 's intention of removing into devonshire . </s>
<s> the house , too , as described by sir john , was on so simple a scale , and the rent so uncommonly moderate , as to leave her no right of objection on either point ; and , therefore , though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy , though it was a removal from the vicinity of norland beyond her wishes , she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence . </s>
<s> no sooner was her answer dispatched , than mrs. dashwood indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son - in - law and his wife that she was provided with a house , and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it . </s>
<s> they heard her with surprise . </s>
<s> mrs. john dashwood said nothing ; but her husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from norland . </s>
<s> she had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into devonshire . </s>
<s> edward turned hastily towards her , on hearing this , and , in a voice of surprise and concern , which required no explanation to her , repeated , " devonshire ! </s>
<s> are you , indeed , going there ? </s>
<s> so far from hence ! </s>
<s> and to what part of it ? " </s>
<s> she explained the situation . </s>
<s> it was within four miles northward of exeter . </s>
<s> " it is but a cottage , " she continued , " but i hope to see many of my friends in it . </s>
<s> a room or two can easily be added ; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me , i am sure i will find none in accommodating them . " </s>
<s> she concluded with a very kind invitation to mr. and mrs. john dashwood to visit her at barton ; and to edward she gave one with still greater affection . </s>
<s> though her late conversation with her daughter - in - law had made her resolve on remaining at norland no longer than was unavoidable , it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that point to which it principally tended . </s>
<s> to separate edward and elinor was as far from being her object as ever ; and she wished to show mrs. john dashwood , by this pointed invitation to her brother , how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match . </s>
<s> mr. john dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture . </s>
<s> he really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion ; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable . </s>
<s> the furniture was all sent around by water . </s>
<s> it chiefly consisted of household linen , plate , china , and books , with a handsome pianoforte of marianne 's . </s>
<s> mrs. john dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh : she could not help feeling it hard that as mrs. dashwood 's income would be so trifling in comparison with their own , she should have any handsome article of furniture . </s>
<s> mrs. dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth ; it was ready furnished , and she might have immediate possession . </s>
<s> no difficulty arose on either side in the agreement ; and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at norland , and to determine her future household , before she set off for the west ; and this , as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her , was soon done . </s>
<s> the horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death , and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage , she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter . </s>
<s> for the comfort of her children , had she consulted only her own wishes , she would have kept it ; but the discretion of elinor prevailed . </s>
<s> _ her _ wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three ; two maids and a man , with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at norland . </s>
<s> the man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into devonshire , to prepare the house for their mistress 's arrival ; for as lady middleton was entirely unknown to mrs. dashwood , she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at barton park ; and she relied so undoubtingly on sir john 's description of the house , as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own . </s>
<s> her eagerness to be gone from norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter - in - law in the prospect of her removal ; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure . </s>
<s> now was the time when her son - in - law 's promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled . </s>
<s> since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate , their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment . </s>
<s> but mrs. dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind , and to be convinced , from the general drift of his discourse , that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at norland . </s>
<s> he so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping , and of the perpetual demands upon his purse , which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to , that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away . </s>
<s> in a very few weeks from the day which brought sir john middleton 's first letter to norland , every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable mrs. dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey . </s>
<s> many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved . </s>
<s> " dear , dear norland ! " said marianne , as she wandered alone before the house , on the last evening of their being there ; " when shall i cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere ! </s>
<s> oh ! happy house , could you know what i suffer in now viewing you from this spot , from whence perhaps i may view you no more ! </s>
<s> and you , ye well - known trees!--but you will continue the same . </s>
<s> no leaf will decay because we are removed , nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer ! </s>
<s> no ; you will continue the same ; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion , and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade ! </s>
<s> but who will remain to enjoy you ? " </s>
<s> the first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant . </s>
<s> but as they drew towards the end of it , their interest in the appearance of a country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection , and a view of barton valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness . </s>
<s> it was a pleasant fertile spot , well wooded , and rich in pasture . </s>
<s> after winding along it for more than a mile , they reached their own house . </s>
<s> a small green court was the whole of its demesne in front ; and a neat wicket gate admitted them into it . </s>
<s> as a house , barton cottage , though small , was comfortable and compact ; but as a cottage it was defective , for the building was regular , the roof was tiled , the window shutters were not painted green , nor were the walls covered with honeysuckles . </s>
<s> a narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden behind . </s>
<s> on each side of the entrance was a sitting room , about sixteen feet square ; and beyond them were the offices and the stairs . </s>
<s> four bedrooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house . </s>
<s> it had not been built many years and was in good repair . </s>
<s> in comparison of norland , it was poor and small indeed!--but the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon dried away . </s>
<s> they were cheered by the joy of the servants on their arrival , and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy . </s>
<s> it was very early in september ; the season was fine , and from first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather , they received an impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending it to their lasting approbation . </s>
<s> the situation of the house was good . </s>
<s> high hills rose immediately behind , and at no great distance on each side ; some of which were open downs , the others cultivated and woody . </s>
<s> the village of barton was chiefly on one of these hills , and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows . </s>
<s> the prospect in front was more extensive ; it commanded the whole of the valley , and reached into the country beyond . </s>
<s> the hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction ; under another name , and in another course , it branched out again between two of the steepest of them . </s>
<s> with the size and furniture of the house mrs. dashwood was upon the whole well satisfied ; for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable , yet to add and improve was a delight to her ; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments . </s>
<s> " as for the house itself , to be sure , " said she , " it is too small for our family , but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present , as it is too late in the year for improvements . </s>
<s> perhaps in the spring , if i have plenty of money , as i dare say i shall , we may think about building . </s>
<s> these parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as i hope to see often collected here ; and i have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other , and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance ; this , with a new drawing room which may be easily added , and a bed - chamber and garret above , will make it a very snug little cottage . </s>
<s> i could wish the stairs were handsome . </s>
<s> but one must not expect every thing ; though i suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them . </s>
<s> i shall see how much i am before - hand with the world in the spring , and we will plan our improvements accordingly . " </s>
<s> in the mean time , till all these alterations could be made from the savings of an income of five hundred a - year by a woman who never saved in her life , they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it was ; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns , and endeavoring , by placing around them books and other possessions , to form themselves a home . </s>
<s> marianne 's pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of ; and elinor 's drawings were affixed to the walls of their sitting room . </s>
<s> in such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord , who called to welcome them to barton , and to offer them every accommodation from his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient . </s>
<s> sir john middleton was a good looking man about forty . </s>
<s> he had formerly visited at stanhill , but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him . </s>
<s> his countenance was thoroughly good - humoured ; and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter . </s>
<s> their arrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction , and their comfort to be an object of real solicitude to him . </s>
<s> he said much of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family , and pressed them so cordially to dine at barton park every day till they were better settled at home , that , though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility , they could not give offence . </s>
<s> his kindness was not confined to words ; for within an hour after he left them , a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park , which was followed before the end of the day by a present of game . </s>
<s> he insisted , moreover , on conveying all their letters to and from the post for them , and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day . </s>
<s> lady middleton had sent a very civil message by him , denoting her intention of waiting on mrs. dashwood as soon as she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience ; and as this message was answered by an invitation equally polite , her ladyship was introduced to them the next day . </s>
<s> [ illustration : _ so shy before company . _ ] </s>
<s> they were , of course , very anxious to see a person on whom so much of their comfort at barton must depend ; and the elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes . </s>
<s> lady middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty ; her face was handsome , her figure tall and striking , and her address graceful . </s>
<s> her manners had all the elegance which her husband 's wanted . </s>
<s> but they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth ; and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration , by showing that , though perfectly well - bred , she was reserved , cold , and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common - place inquiry or remark . </s>
<s> conversation however was not wanted , for sir john was very chatty , and lady middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child , a fine little boy about six years old , by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity , for they had to enquire his name and age , admire his beauty , and ask him questions which his mother answered for him , while he hung about her and held down his head , to the great surprise of her ladyship , who wondered at his being so shy before company , as he could make noise enough at home . </s>
<s> on every formal visit a child ought to be of the party , by way of provision for discourse . </s>
<s> in the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother , and in what particular he resembled either , for of course every body differed , and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others . </s>
<s> an opportunity was soon to be given to the dashwoods of debating on the rest of the children , as sir john would not leave the house without securing their promise of dining at the park the next day . </s>
<s> barton park was about half a mile from the cottage . </s>
<s> the ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley , but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill . </s>
<s> the house was large and handsome ; and the middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance . </s>
<s> the former was for sir john 's gratification , the latter for that of his lady . </s>
<s> they were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house , and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood . </s>
<s> it was necessary to the happiness of both ; for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour , they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined their employments , unconnected with such as society produced , within a very narrow compass . </s>
<s> sir john was a sportsman , lady middleton a mother . </s>
<s> he hunted and shot , and she humoured her children ; and these were their only resources . </s>
<s> lady middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round , while sir john 's independent employments were in existence only half the time . </s>
<s> continual engagements at home and abroad , however , supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education ; supported the good spirits of sir john , and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife . </s>
<s> lady middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table , and of all her domestic arrangements ; and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties . </s>
<s> but sir john 's satisfaction in society was much more real ; he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold , and the noisier they were the better was he pleased . </s>
<s> he was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood , </s>
<s> for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors , and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the insatiable appetite of fifteen . </s>
<s> the arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him , and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at barton . </s>
<s> the miss dashwoods were young , pretty , and unaffected . </s>
<s> it was enough to secure his good opinion ; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to make her mind as captivating as her person . </s>
<s> the friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those , whose situation might be considered , in comparison with the past , as unfortunate . </s>
<s> in showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart ; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage , he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman ; for a sportsman , though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise , is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor . </s>
<s> mrs. dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by sir john , who welcomed them to barton park with unaffected sincerity ; and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day before , at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them . </s>
<s> they would see , he said , only one gentleman there besides himself ; a particular friend who was staying at the park , but who was neither very young nor very gay . </s>
<s> he hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party , and could assure them it should never happen so again . </s>
<s> he had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some addition to their number , but it was moonlight and every body was full of engagements . </s>
<s> luckily lady middleton 's mother had arrived at barton within the last hour , and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman , he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine . </s>
<s> the young ladies , as well as their mother , were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party , and wished for no more . </s>
<s> mrs. jennings , lady middleton 's mother , was a good - humoured , merry , fat , elderly woman , who talked a great deal , seemed very happy , and rather vulgar . </s>
<s> she was full of jokes and laughter , and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands ; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in sussex , and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not . </s>
<s> marianne was vexed at it for her sister 's sake , and turned her eyes towards elinor to see how she bore these attacks , with an earnestness which gave elinor far more pain than could arise from such common - place raillery as mrs. jennings 's . </s>
<s> colonel brandon , the friend of sir john , seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend , than lady middleton was to be his wife , or mrs. jennings to be lady middleton 's mother . </s>
<s> he was silent and grave . </s>
<s> his appearance however was not unpleasing , in spite of his being in the opinion of marianne and margaret an absolute old bachelor , for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty ; but though his face was not handsome , his countenance was sensible , and his address was particularly gentlemanlike . </s>
<s> there was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the dashwoods ; but the cold insipidity of lady middleton was so particularly repulsive , that in comparison of it the gravity of colonel brandon , and even the boisterous mirth of sir john and his mother - in - law was interesting . </s>
<s> lady middleton seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner , who pulled her about , tore her clothes , and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves . </s>
<s> in the evening , as marianne was discovered to be musical , she was invited to play . </s>
<s> the instrument was unlocked , every body prepared to be charmed , and marianne , who sang very well , at their request went through the chief of the songs which lady middleton had brought into the family on her marriage , and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte , for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music , although by her mother 's account , she had played extremely well , and by her own was very fond of it . </s>
<s> marianne 's performance was highly applauded . </s>
<s> sir john was loud in his admiration at the end of every song , and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted . </s>
<s> lady middleton frequently called him to order , wondered how any one 's attention could be diverted from music for a moment , and asked marianne to sing a particular song which marianne had just finished . </s>
<s> colonel brandon alone , of all the party , heard her without being in raptures . </s>
<s> he paid her only the compliment of attention ; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion , which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste . </s>
<s> his pleasure in music , though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own , was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others ; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment . </s>
<s> she was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel 's advanced state of life which humanity required . </s>
<s> mrs. jennings was a widow with an ample jointure . </s>
<s> she had only two daughters , both of whom she had lived to see respectably married , and she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world . </s>
<s> in the promotion of this object she was zealously active , as far as her ability reached ; and missed no opportunity of projecting weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance . </s>
<s> she was remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments , and had enjoyed the advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man ; and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at barton decisively to pronounce that colonel brandon was very much in love with marianne dashwood . </s>
<s> she rather suspected it to be so , on the very first evening of their being together , from his listening so attentively while she sang to them ; and when the visit was returned by the middletons ' dining at the cottage , the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again . </s>
<s> it must be so . </s>
<s> she was perfectly convinced of it . </s>
<s> it would be an excellent match , for _ he _ was rich , and _ she _ was handsome . </s>
<s> mrs. jennings had been anxious to see colonel brandon well married , ever since her connection with sir john first brought him to her knowledge ; and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl . </s>
<s> the immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable , for it supplied her with endless jokes against them both . </s>
<s> at the park she laughed at the colonel , and in the cottage at marianne . </s>
<s> to the former her raillery was probably , as far as it regarded only himself , perfectly indifferent ; but to the latter it was at first incomprehensible ; and when its object was understood , she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity , or censure its impertinence , for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel 's advanced years , and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor . </s>
<s> mrs. dashwood , who could not think a man five years younger than herself , so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter , ventured to clear mrs. jennings from the probability of wishing to throw ridicule on his age . </s>
<s> " but at least , mamma , you can not deny the absurdity of the accusation , though you may not think it intentionally ill - natured . </s>
<s> colonel brandon is certainly younger than mrs. jennings , but he is old enough to be _ my _ father ; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love , must have long outlived every sensation of the kind . </s>
<s> it is too ridiculous ! </s>
<s> when is a man to be safe from such wit , if age and infirmity will not protect him ? " </s>
<s> " infirmity ! " said elinor , " do you call colonel brandon infirm ? </s>
<s> i can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother ; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs ! " </s>
<s> " did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism ? and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life ? " </s>
<s> " my dearest child , " said her mother , laughing , " at this rate you must be in continual terror of _ my _ decay ; and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty . " </s>
<s> " mamma , you are not doing me justice . </s>
<s> i know very well that colonel brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature . </s>
<s> he may live twenty years longer . </s>
<s> but thirty - five has nothing to do with matrimony . " </s>
<s> " perhaps , " said elinor , " thirty - five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together . </s>
<s> but if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty , i should not think colonel brandon 's being thirty - five any objection to his marrying _ her _ . " </s>
<s> " a woman of seven and twenty , " said marianne , after pausing a moment , " can never hope to feel or inspire affection again , and if her home be uncomfortable , or her fortune small , i can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse , for the sake of the provision and security of a wife . </s>
<s> in his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable . </s>
<s> it would be a compact of convenience , and the world would be satisfied . </s>
<s> in my eyes it would be no marriage at all , but that would be nothing . </s>
<s> to me it would seem only a commercial exchange , in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other . " </s>
<s> " it would be impossible , i know , " replied elinor , " to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty - five anything near enough to love , to make him a desirable companion to her . </s>
<s> but i must object to your dooming colonel brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber , merely because he chanced to complain yesterday ( a very cold damp day ) of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders . " </s>
<s> " but he talked of flannel waistcoats , " said marianne ; " and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches , cramps , rheumatisms , and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble . " </s>
<s> " had he been only in a violent fever , you would not have despised him half so much . </s>
<s> confess , marianne , is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek , hollow eye , and quick pulse of a fever ? " </s>
<s> soon after this , upon elinor 's leaving the room , " mamma , " said marianne , " i have an alarm on the subject of illness which i can not conceal from you . </s>
<s> i am sure edward ferrars is not well . </s>
<s> we have now been here almost a fortnight , and yet he does not come . </s>
<s> nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay . </s>
<s> what else can detain him at norland ? " </s>
<s> " had you any idea of his coming so soon ? " said mrs. dashwood . </s>
<s> " i had none . </s>
<s> on the contrary , if i have felt any anxiety at all on the subject , it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation , when i talked of his coming to barton . </s>
<s> does elinor expect him already ? " </s>
<s> i have never mentioned it to her , but of course she must . " </s>
<s> " i rather think you are mistaken , for when i was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bed - chamber , she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it , as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time . " </s>
<s> " how strange this is ! </s>
<s> what can be the meaning of it ! </s>
<s> but the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable ! </s>
<s> how cold , how composed were their last adieus ! </s>
<s> how languid their conversation the last evening of their being together ! </s>
<s> in edward 's farewell there was no distinction between elinor and me : it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both . </s>
<s> twice did i leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning , and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room . </s>
<s> and elinor , in quitting norland and edward , cried not as i did . </s>
<s> even now her self - command is invariable . </s>
<s> when is she dejected or melancholy ? </s>
<s> when does she try to avoid society , or appear restless and dissatisfied in it ? " </s>
<s> the dashwoods were now settled at barton with tolerable comfort to themselves . </s>
<s> the house and the garden , with all the objects surrounding them , were now become familiar , and the ordinary pursuits which had given to norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater enjoyment than norland had been able to afford , since the loss of their father . </s>
<s> sir john middleton , who called on them every day for the first fortnight , and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home , could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed . </s>
<s> their visitors , except those from barton park , were not many ; for , in spite of sir john 's urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the neighbourhood , and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service , the independence of mrs. dashwood 's spirit overcame the wish of society for her children ; and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk . </s>
<s> there were but few who could be so classed ; and it was not all of them that were attainable . </s>
<s> about a mile and a half from the cottage , along the narrow winding valley of allenham , which issued from that of barton , as formerly described , the girls had , in one of their earliest walks , discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which , by reminding them a little of norland , interested their imagination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it . </s>
<s> but they learnt , on enquiry , that its possessor , an elderly lady of very good character , was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world , and never stirred from home . </s>
<s> the whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks . </s>
<s> the high downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits , were a happy alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties ; and towards one of these hills did marianne and margaret one memorable morning direct their steps , attracted by the partial sunshine of a showery sky , and unable longer to bear the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned . </s>
<s> the weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book , in spite of marianne 's declaration that the day would be lastingly fair , and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off from their hills ; and the two girls set off together . </s>
<s> they gaily ascended the downs , rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky ; and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south - westerly wind , they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and elinor from sharing such delightful sensations . </s>
<s> " is there a felicity in the world , " said marianne , " superior to this?--margaret , we will walk here at least two hours . " </s>
<s> margaret agreed , and they pursued their way against the wind , resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer , when suddenly the clouds united over their heads , and a driving rain set full in their face . </s>
<s> chagrined and surprised , they were obliged , though unwillingly , to turn back , for no shelter was nearer than their own house . </s>
<s> one consolation however remained for them , to which the exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety,--it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate . </s>
<s> they set off . </s>
<s> marianne had at first the advantage , but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground ; and margaret , unable to stop herself to assist her , was involuntarily hurried along , and reached the bottom in safety . </s>
<s> a gentleman carrying a gun , with two pointers playing round him , was passing up the hill and within a few yards of marianne , when her accident happened . </s>
<s> he put down his gun and ran to her assistance . </s>
<s> she had raised herself from the ground , but her foot had been twisted in her fall , and she was scarcely able to stand . </s>
<s> the gentleman offered his services ; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary , took her up in his arms without farther delay , and carried her down the hill . </s>
<s> then passing through the garden , the gate of which had been left open by margaret , he bore her directly into the house , whither margaret was just arrived , and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour . </s>
<s> elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance , and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance , he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause , in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person , which was uncommonly handsome , received additional charms from his voice and expression . </s>
<s> had he been even old , ugly , and vulgar , the gratitude and kindness of mrs. dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child ; but the influence of youth , beauty , and elegance , gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings . </s>
<s> she thanked him again and again ; and , with a sweetness of address which always attended her , invited him to be seated . </s>
<s> this he declined , as he was dirty and wet . </s>
<s> mrs. dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged . </s>
<s> his name , he replied , was willoughby , and his present home was at allenham , from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after miss dashwood . </s>
<s> the honour was readily granted , and he then departed , to make himself still more interesting , in the midst of a heavy rain . </s>
<s> his manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the theme of general admiration , and the laugh which his gallantry raised against marianne received particular spirit from his exterior attractions . </s>
<s> marianne herself had seen less of his person than the rest , for the confusion which crimsoned over her face , on his lifting her up , had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house . </s>
<s> but she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others , and with an energy which always adorned her praise . </s>
<s> his person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story ; and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality , there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her . </s>
<s> every circumstance belonging to him was interesting . </s>
<s> his name was good , his residence was in their favourite village , and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting - jacket was the most becoming . </s>
<s> her imagination was busy , her reflections were pleasant , and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded . </s>
<s> sir john called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of doors ; and marianne 's accident being related to him , he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of willoughby at allenham . </s>
<s> " willoughby ! " cried sir john ; " what , is _ he _ in the country ? </s>
<s> that is good news however ; i will ride over tomorrow , and ask him to dinner on thursday . " </s>
<s> " you know him then , " said mrs. dashwood . </s>
<s> " know him ! </s>
<s> to be sure i do . </s>
<s> why , he is down here every year . " </s>
<s> " and what sort of a young man is he ? " </s>
<s> " as good a kind of fellow as ever lived , i assure you . </s>
<s> a very decent shot , and there is not a bolder rider in england . " </s>
<s> " and is that all you can say for him ? " cried marianne , indignantly . " </s>
<s> but what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance ? </s>
<s> what his pursuits , his talents , and genius ? " </s>
<s> sir john was rather puzzled . </s>
<s> " upon my soul , " said he , " i do not know much about him as to all _ that . _ </s>
<s> but he is a pleasant , good humoured fellow , and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer i ever saw . </s>
<s> was she out with him today ? " </s>
<s> but marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of mr. willoughby 's pointer , than he could describe to her the shades of his mind . </s>
<s> " but who is he ? " said elinor . </s>
<s> " where does he come from ? </s>
<s> has he a house at allenham ? " </s>
<s> on this point sir john could give more certain intelligence ; and he told them that mr. willoughby had no property of his own in the country ; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at allenham court , to whom he was related , and whose possessions he was to inherit ; adding , " yes , yes , he is very well worth catching i can tell you , miss dashwood ; he has a pretty little estate of his own in somersetshire besides ; and if i were you , i would not give him up to my younger sister , in spite of all this tumbling down hills . </s>
<s> miss marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself . </s>
<s> brandon will be jealous , if she does not take care . " </s>
<s> " i do not believe , " said mrs. dashwood , with a good humoured smile , " that mr. willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of _ my _ daughters towards what you call _ catching him . </s>
<s> _ it is not an employment to which they have been brought up . </s>
<s> men are very safe with us , let them be ever so rich . </s>
<s> i am glad to find , however , from what you say , that he is a respectable young man , and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible . " </s>
<s> " he is as good a sort of fellow , i believe , as ever lived , " repeated sir john . </s>
<s> " i remember last christmas at a little hop at the park , he danced from eight o'clock till four , without once sitting down . " </s>
<s> " did he indeed ? " cried marianne with sparkling eyes , " and with elegance , with spirit ? " </s>
<s> yes ; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert . " </s>
<s> " that is what i like ; that is what a young man ought to be . </s>
<s> whatever be his pursuits , his eagerness in them should know no moderation , and leave him no sense of fatigue . " </s>
<s> " aye , aye , i see how it will be , " said sir john , " i see how it will be . </s>
<s> you will be setting your cap at him now , and never think of poor brandon . " </s>
<s> " that is an expression , sir john , " said marianne , warmly , " which i particularly dislike . </s>
<s> i abhor every common - place phrase by which wit is intended ; and ' setting one 's cap at a man , ' or ' making a conquest , ' are the most odious of all . </s>
<s> their tendency is gross and illiberal ; and if their construction could ever be deemed clever , time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity . " </s>
<s> sir john did not much understand this reproof ; but he laughed as heartily as if he did , and then </s>
<s> " ay , you will make conquests enough , i dare say , one way or other . </s>
<s> poor brandon ! </s>
<s> he is quite smitten already , and he is very well worth setting your cap at , i can tell you , in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles . " </s>
<s> marianne 's preserver , as margaret , with more elegance than precision , styled willoughby , called at the cottage early the next morning to make his personal enquiries . </s>
<s> he was received by mrs. dashwood with more than politeness ; with a kindness which sir john 's account of him and her own gratitude prompted ; and every thing that passed during the visit tended to assure him of the sense , elegance , mutual affection , and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him . </s>
<s> of their personal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced . </s>
<s> miss dashwood had a delicate complexion , regular features , and a remarkably pretty figure . </s>
<s> marianne was still handsomer . </s>
<s> her form , though not so correct as her sister 's , in having the advantage of height , was more striking ; and her face was so lovely , that when in the common ca nt of praise , she was called a beautiful girl , truth was less violently outraged than usually happens . </s>
<s> her skin was very brown , but , from its transparency , her complexion was uncommonly brilliant ; her features were all good ; her smile was sweet and attractive ; and in her eyes , which were very dark , there was a life , a spirit , an eagerness , which could hardily be seen without delight . </s>
<s> from willoughby their expression was at first held back , by the embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created . </s>
<s> but when this passed away , when her spirits became collected , when she saw that to the perfect good - breeding of the gentleman , he united frankness and vivacity , and above all , when she heard him declare , that of music and dancing he was passionately fond , she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay . </s>
<s> it was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk . </s>
<s> she could not be silent when such points were introduced , and she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion . </s>
<s> they speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual , and that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related to either . </s>
<s> encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions , she proceeded to question him on the subject of books ; her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous a delight , that any young man of five and twenty must have been insensible indeed , not to become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works , however disregarded before . </s>
<s> their taste was strikingly alike . </s>
<s> the same books , the same passages were idolized by each ; or if any difference appeared , any objection arose , it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed . </s>
<s> he acquiesced in all her decisions , caught all her enthusiasm ; and long before his visit concluded , they conversed with the familiarity of a long - established acquaintance . </s>
<s> " well , marianne , " said elinor , as soon as he had left them , " for _ one _ morning </s>
<s> i think you have done pretty well . </s>
<s> you have already ascertained mr. willoughby 's opinion in almost every matter of importance . </s>
<s> you know what he thinks of cowper and scott ; you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought , and you have received every assurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper . </s>
<s> but how is your acquaintance to be long supported , under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse ? </s>
<s> you will soon have exhausted each favourite topic . </s>
<s> another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty , and second marriages , and then you can have nothing farther to ask . " </s>
<s> " elinor , " cried marianne , " is this fair ? </s>
<s> is this just ? </s>
<s> are my ideas so scanty ? </s>
<s> but i see what you mean . </s>
<s> i have been too much at my ease , too happy , too frank . </s>
<s> i have erred against every common - place notion of decorum ; i have been open and sincere where i ought to have been reserved , spiritless , dull , and deceitful:--had i talked only of the weather and the roads , and had i spoken only once in ten minutes , this reproach would have been spared . " </s>
<s> " my love , " said her mother , " you must not be offended with elinor -- she was only in jest . </s>
<s> i should scold her myself , if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend . </s>
<s> marianne was softened in a moment . </s>
<s> willoughby , on his side , gave every proof of his pleasure in their acquaintance , which an evident wish of improving it could offer . </s>
<s> he came to them every day . </s>
<s> to enquire after marianne was at first his excuse ; but the encouragement of his reception , to which every day gave greater kindness , made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible , by marianne 's perfect recovery . </s>
<s> she was confined for some days to the house ; but never had any confinement been less irksome . </s>
<s> willoughby was a young man of good abilities , quick imagination , lively spirits , and open , affectionate manners . </s>
<s> he was exactly formed to engage marianne 's heart , for with all this , he joined not only a captivating person , but a natural ardour of mind which was now roused and increased by the example of her own , and which recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else . </s>
<s> his society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment . </s>
<s> they read , they talked , they sang together ; his musical talents were considerable ; and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which edward had unfortunately wanted . </s>
<s> in mrs. dashwood 's estimation he was as faultless as in marianne 's ; and elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity , in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister , of saying too much what he thought on every occasion , without attention to persons or circumstances . </s>
<s> in hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people , in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged , and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety , he displayed a want of caution which elinor could not approve , in spite of all that he and marianne could say in its support . </s>
<s> marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half , of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection , had been rash and unjustifiable . </s>
<s> willoughby was all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every brighter period , as capable of attaching her ; and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest , as his abilities were strong . </s>
<s> [ illustration : _ they sang together . _ ] </s>
<s> her mother too , in whose mind not one speculative thought of their marriage had been raised , by his prospect of riches , was led before the end of a week to hope and expect it ; and secretly to congratulate herself on having gained two such sons - in - law as edward and willoughby . </s>
<s> colonel brandon 's partiality for marianne , which had so early been discovered by his friends , now first became perceptible to elinor , when it ceased to be noticed by them . </s>
<s> their attention and wit were drawn off to his more fortunate rival ; and the raillery which the other had incurred before any partiality arose , was removed when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility . </s>
<s> elinor was obliged , though unwillingly , to believe that the sentiments which mrs. jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction , were now actually excited by her sister ; and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of mr. willoughby , an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of colonel brandon . </s>
<s> she saw it with concern ; for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope , when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty ? </s>
<s> and as she could not even wish him successful , she heartily wished him indifferent . </s>
<s> she liked him -- in spite of his gravity and reserve , she beheld in him an object of interest . </s>
<s> his manners , though serious , were mild ; and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloominess of temper . </s>
<s> sir john had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments , which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man , and she regarded him with respect and compassion . </s>
<s> perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by willoughby and marianne , who , prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young , seemed resolved to undervalue his merits . </s>
<s> " brandon is just the kind of man , " said willoughby one day , when they were talking of him together , " whom every body speaks well of , and nobody cares about ; whom all are delighted to see , and nobody remembers to talk to . " </s>
<s> " that is exactly what i think of him , " cried marianne . </s>
<s> " do not boast of it , however , " said elinor , " for it is injustice in both of you . </s>
<s> he is highly esteemed by all the family at the park , and i never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him . " </s>
<s> " that he is patronised by _ you _ , " replied willoughby , " is certainly in his favour ; but as for the esteem of the others , it is a reproach in itself . </s>
<s> who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as lady middleton and mrs. jennings , that could command the indifference of any body else ? " </s>
<s> " but perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and marianne will make amends for the regard of lady middleton and her mother . </s>
<s> if their praise is censure , your censure may be praise , for they are not more undiscerning , than you are prejudiced and unjust . " </s>
<s> in defence of your _ protege _ you can even be saucy . " </s>
<s> " my _ protege _ , as you call him , is a sensible man ; and sense will always have attractions for me . </s>
<s> yes , marianne , even in a man between thirty and forty . </s>
<s> he has seen a great deal of the world ; has been abroad , has read , and has a thinking mind . </s>
<s> i have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects ; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good - breeding and good nature . " </s>
<s> " that is to say , " cried marianne contemptuously , " he has told you , that in the east indies the climate is hot , and the mosquitoes are troublesome . " </s>
<s> " he _ would _ have told me so , i doubt not , had i made any such inquiries , but they happened to be points on which i had been previously informed . " </s>
<s> " perhaps , " said willoughby , " his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs , gold mohrs , and palanquins . " </s>
<s> " i may venture to say that _ his _ observations have stretched much further than _ your _ candour . </s>
<s> but why should you dislike him ? " </s>
<s> " i do not dislike him . </s>
<s> i consider him , on the contrary , as a very respectable man , who has every body 's good word , and nobody 's notice ; who , has more money than he can spend , more time than he knows how to employ , and two new coats every year . " </s>
<s> " add to which , " cried marianne , " that he has neither genius , taste , nor spirit . </s>
<s> that his understanding has no brilliancy , his feelings no ardour , and his voice no expression . " </s>
<s> " you decide on his imperfections so much in the mass , " replied elinor , " and so much on the strength of your own imagination , that the commendation i am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid . </s>
<s> i can only pronounce him to be a sensible man , well - bred , well - informed , of gentle address , and , i believe , possessing an amiable heart . " </s>
<s> " miss dashwood , " cried willoughby , " you are now using me unkindly . </s>
<s> you are endeavouring to disarm me by reason , and to convince me against my will . </s>
<s> but it will not do . </s>
<s> you shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful . </s>
<s> i have three unanswerable reasons for disliking colonel brandon ; he threatened me with rain when i wanted it to be fine ; he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle , and i can not persuade him to buy my brown mare . </s>
<s> if it will be any satisfaction to you , however , to be told , that i believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable , i am ready to confess it . </s>
<s> and in return for an acknowledgment , which must give me some pain , you can not deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever . " </s>
<s> little had mrs. dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came into devonshire , that so many engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented themselves , or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment . </s>
<s> yet such was the case . </s>
<s> when marianne was recovered , the schemes of amusement at home and abroad , which sir john had been previously forming , were put into execution . </s>
<s> the private balls at the park then began ; and parties on the water were made and accomplished as often as a showery october would allow . </s>
<s> in every meeting of the kind willoughby was included ; and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the dashwoods , to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of marianne , of marking his animated admiration of her , and of receiving , in her behaviour to himself , the most pointed assurance of her affection . </s>
<s> elinor could not be surprised at their attachment . </s>
<s> she only wished that it were less openly shown ; and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self - command to marianne . </s>
<s> but marianne abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve ; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable , appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort , but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common - place and mistaken notions . </s>
<s> willoughby thought the same ; and their behaviour at all times , was an illustration of their opinions . </s>
<s> when he was present she had no eyes for any one else . </s>
<s> every thing he did , was right . </s>
<s> every thing he said , was clever . </s>
<s> if their evenings at the park were concluded with cards , he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand . </s>
<s> if dancing formed the amusement of the night , they were partners for half the time ; and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances , were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else . </s>
<s> such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at ; but ridicule could not shame , and seemed hardly to provoke them . </s>
<s> mrs. dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them . </s>
<s> to her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind . </s>
<s> this was the season of happiness to marianne . </s>
<s> her heart was devoted to willoughby , and the fond attachment to norland , which she brought with her from sussex , was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before , by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home . </s>
<s> elinor 's happiness was not so great . </s>
<s> her heart was not so much at ease , nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure . </s>
<s> they afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind , nor that could teach her to think of norland with less regret than ever . </s>
<s> neither lady middleton nor mrs. jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed ; although the latter was an everlasting talker , and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse . </s>
<s> she had already repeated her own history to elinor three or four times ; and had elinor 's memory been equal to her means of improvement , she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of mr. jennings 's last illness , and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died . </s>
<s> lady middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent . </s>
<s> elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do . </s>
<s> towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them ; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired . </s>
<s> she had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before . </s>
<s> her insipidity was invariable , for even her spirits were always the same ; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband , provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her , she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home ; and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others , by any share in their conversation , that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys . </s>
<s> in colonel brandon alone , of all her new acquaintance , did elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities , excite the interest of friendship , or give pleasure as a companion . </s>
<s> willoughby was out of the question . </s>
<s> her admiration and regard , even her sisterly regard , was all his own ; but he was a lover ; his attentions were wholly marianne 's , and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing . </s>
<s> colonel brandon , unfortunately for himself , had no such encouragement to think only of marianne , and in conversing with elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister . </s>
<s> elinor 's compassion for him increased , as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him . </s>
<s> this suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from him one evening at the park , when they were sitting down together by mutual consent , while the others were dancing . </s>
<s> his eyes were fixed on marianne , and , </s>
<s> after a silence of some minutes , he said , with a faint smile , " your sister , i understand , does not approve of second attachments . " </s>
<s> " no , " replied elinor , " her opinions are all romantic . " </s>
<s> " or rather , as i believe , she considers them impossible to exist . " </s>
<s> " i believe she does . </s>
<s> but how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father , who had himself two wives , i know not . </s>
<s> a few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation ; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are , by any body but herself . " </s>
<s> " this will probably be the case , " he replied ; " and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind , that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions . " </s>
<s> " i can not agree with you there , " said elinor . </s>
<s> " there are inconveniences attending such feelings as marianne 's , which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world can not atone for . </s>
<s> her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought ; and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look forward to as her greatest possible advantage . " </s>
<s> after a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying-- </s>
<s> " does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment ? or is it equally criminal in every body ? </s>
<s> are those who have been disappointed in their first choice , whether from the inconstancy of its object , or the perverseness of circumstances , to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives ? " </s>
<s> " upon my word , i am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles . </s>
<s> i only know that i never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment 's being pardonable . " </s>
<s> " this , " said he , " can not hold ; but a change , a total change of sentiments -- no , no , do not desire it ; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way , how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common , and too dangerous ! </s>
<s> i speak from experience . </s>
<s> i once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister , who thought and judged like her , but who from an enforced change -- from a series of unfortunate circumstances-- " here he stopped suddenly ; appeared to think that he had said too much , and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures , which might not otherwise have entered elinor 's head . </s>
<s> the lady would probably have passed without suspicion , had he not convinced miss dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips . </s>
<s> as it was , it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard . </s>
<s> elinor attempted no more . </s>
<s> but marianne , in her place , would not have done so little . </s>
<s> the whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination ; and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love . </s>
<s> as elinor and marianne were walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of news to her sister , which in spite of all that she knew before of marianne 's imprudence and want of thought , surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both . </s>
<s> marianne told her , with the greatest delight , that willoughby had given her a horse , one that he had bred himself on his estate in somersetshire , and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman . </s>
<s> without considering that it was not in her mother 's plan to keep any horse , that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift , she must buy another for the servant , and keep a servant to ride it , and after all , build a stable to receive them , she had accepted the present without hesitation , and told her sister of it in raptures . </s>
<s> " he intends to send his groom into somersetshire immediately for it , " she added , " and when it arrives we will ride every day . </s>
<s> you shall share its use with me . </s>
<s> imagine to yourself , my dear elinor , the delight of a gallop on some of these downs . " </s>
<s> most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair ; and for some time she refused to submit to them . </s>
<s> as to an additional servant , the expense would be a trifle ; mamma she was sure would never object to it ; and any horse would do for _ him _ ; he might always get one at the park ; as to a stable , the merest shed would be sufficient . </s>
<s> elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a man so little , or at least so lately known to her . </s>
<s> this was too much . </s>
<s> " you are mistaken , elinor , " said she warmly , " in supposing i know very little of willoughby . </s>
<s> i have not known him long indeed , but i am much better acquainted with him , than i am with any other creature in the world , except yourself and mama . </s>
<s> it is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy ; it is disposition alone . </s>
<s> seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other , and seven days are more than enough for others . </s>
<s> i should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother , than from willoughby . </s>
<s> of john i know very little , though we have lived together for years ; but of willoughby my judgment has long been formed . " </s>
<s> elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more . </s>
<s> she knew her sister 's temper . </s>
<s> opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion . </s>
<s> but by an appeal to her affection for her mother , by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself , if ( as would probably be the case ) she consented to this increase of establishment , marianne was shortly subdued ; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer , and to tell willoughby when she saw him next , that it must be declined . </s>
<s> she was faithful to her word ; and when willoughby called at the cottage , the same day , elinor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice , on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present . </s>
<s> the reasons for this alteration were at the same time related , and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible . </s>
<s> his concern however was very apparent ; and after expressing it with earnestness , he added , in the same low voice , " </s>
<s> but , marianne , the horse is still yours , though you can not use it now . </s>
<s> i shall keep it only till you can claim it . </s>
<s> when you leave barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home , queen mab shall receive you . " </s>
<s> this was all overheard by miss dashwood ; and in the whole of the sentence , in his manner of pronouncing it , and in his addressing her sister by her christian name alone , she instantly saw an intimacy so decided , a meaning so direct , as marked a perfect agreement between them . </s>
<s> from that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other ; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she , or any of their friends , should be left by tempers so frank , to discover it by accident . </s>
<s> margaret related something to her the next day , which placed this matter in a still clearer light . </s>
<s> willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them , and margaret , by being left some time in the parlour with only him and marianne , had had opportunity for observations , which , with a most important face , she communicated to her eldest sister , when they were next by themselves . </s>
<s> " oh , elinor ! " she cried , " i have such a secret to tell you about marianne . </s>
<s> i am sure she will be married to mr. willoughby very soon . " </s>
<s> " you have said so </s>
<s> , " replied elinor , " almost every day since they first met on high - church down ; and they had not known each other a week , i believe , before you were certain that marianne wore his picture round her neck ; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle . " </s>
<s> " but indeed this is quite another thing . </s>
<s> i am sure they will be married very soon , for he has got a lock of her hair . " </s>
<s> " take care , margaret . </s>
<s> it may be only the hair of some great uncle of _ his _ . " </s>
<s> " but , indeed , elinor , it is marianne 's . </s>
<s> i am almost sure it is , for i saw him cut it off . </s>
<s> last night after tea , when you and mama went out of the room , they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be , and he seemed to be begging something of her , and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair , for it was all tumbled down her back ; and he kissed it , and folded it up in a piece of white paper ; and put it into his pocket - book . " </s>
<s> for such particulars , stated on such authority , elinor could not withhold her credit ; nor was she disposed to it , for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself . </s>
<s> margaret 's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister . </s>
<s> when mrs. jennings attacked her one evening at the park , to give the name of the young man who was elinor 's particular favourite , which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her , margaret answered by looking at her sister , and saying , " i must not tell , may i , elinor ? " </s>
<s> this of course made every body laugh ; and elinor tried to laugh too . </s>
<s> but the effort was painful . </s>
<s> she was convinced that margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with mrs. jennings . </s>
<s> [ illustration : _ he cut off a long lock of her hair . _ ] </s>
<s> marianne felt for her most sincerely ; but she did more harm than good to the cause , by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to margaret-- </s>
<s> " remember that whatever your conjectures may be , you have no right to repeat them . " </s>
<s> " i never had any conjectures about it , " replied margaret ; " it was you who told me of it yourself . " </s>
<s> this increased the mirth of the company , and margaret was eagerly pressed to say something more . </s>
<s> " oh ! pray , miss margaret , let us know all about it , " said mrs. jennings . </s>
<s> what is the gentleman 's name ? " </s>
<s> " i must not tell , ma'am . </s>
<s> but i know very well what it is ; and i know where he is too . " </s>
<s> " yes , yes , we can guess where he is ; at his own house at norland to be sure . </s>
<s> he is the curate of the parish i dare say . " </s>
<s> " no , _ that _ he is not . </s>
<s> he is of no profession at all . " </s>
<s> " margaret , " said marianne with great warmth , " you know that all this is an invention of your own , and that there is no such person in existence . " </s>
<s> well , then , he is lately dead , marianne , for i am sure there was such a man once , and his name begins with an f. " </s>
<s> most grateful did elinor feel to lady middleton for observing , at this moment , " that it rained very hard , " though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her , than from her ladyship 's great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted her husband and mother . </s>
<s> the idea however started by her , was immediately pursued by colonel brandon , who was on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others ; and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them . </s>
<s> willoughby opened the piano - forte , and asked marianne to sit down to it ; and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic , it fell to the ground . </s>
<s> but not so easily did elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her . </s>
<s> a party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles from barton , belonging to a brother - in - law of colonel brandon , without whose interest it could not be seen , as the proprietor , who was then abroad , had left strict orders on that head . </s>
<s> the grounds were declared to be highly beautiful , and sir john , who was particularly warm in their praise , might be allowed to be a tolerable judge , for he had formed parties to visit them , at least , twice every summer for the last ten years . </s>
<s> they contained a noble piece of water -- a sail on which was to a form a great part of the morning 's amusement ; cold provisions were to be taken , open carriages only to be employed , and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure . </s>
<s> to some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking , considering the time of year , and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight ; and mrs. dashwood , who had already a cold , was persuaded by elinor to stay at home . </s>
<s> their intended excursion to whitwell turned out very different from what elinor had expected . </s>
<s> she was prepared to be wet through , fatigued , and frightened ; but the event was still more unfortunate , for they did not go at all . </s>
<s> by ten o'clock the whole party was assembled at the park , where they were to breakfast . </s>
<s> the morning was rather favourable , though it had rained all night , as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky , and the sun frequently appeared . </s>
<s> they were all in high spirits and good humour , eager to be happy , and determined to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise . </s>
<s> while they were at breakfast the letters were brought in . </s>
<s> among the rest there was one for colonel brandon:--he took it , looked at the direction , changed colour , and immediately left the room . </s>
<s> " what is the matter with brandon ? " said sir john . </s>
<s> nobody could tell . </s>
<s> " i hope he has had no bad news , " said lady middleton . </s>
<s> " it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly . " </s>
<s> in about five minutes he returned . </s>
<s> " no bad news , colonel , i hope ; " said mrs. jennings , as soon as he entered the room . </s>
<s> " none at all , ma'am , i thank you . " </s>
<s> " was it from avignon ? </s>
<s> i hope it is not to say that your sister is worse . " </s>
<s> " no , ma'am . </s>
<s> it came from town , and is merely a letter of business . " </s>
<s> " but how came the hand to discompose you so much , if it was only a letter of business ? come , come , this wo n't do , colonel ; so let us hear the truth of it . " </s>
<s> " my dear madam , " said lady middleton , " recollect what you are saying . " </s>
<s> " perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin fanny is married ? " said mrs. jennings , without attending to her daughter 's reproof . </s>
<s> " no , indeed , it is not . " </s>
<s> " well , then , i know who it is from , colonel . </s>
<s> and i hope she is well . " </s>
<s> " whom do you mean , ma'am ? " said he , colouring a little . </s>
<s> " oh ! you know who i mean . " </s>
<s> " i am particularly sorry , ma'am , " said he , addressing lady middleton , " that i should receive this letter today , for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town . " </s>
<s> " in town ! " cried mrs. jennings . </s>
<s> " what can you have to do in town at this time of year ? " </s>
<s> my own loss is great , " he continued , " in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party ; but i am the more concerned , as i fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at whitwell . " </s>
<s> what a blow upon them all was this ! </s>
<s> " but if you write a note to the housekeeper , mr. brandon , " said marianne , eagerly , " will it not be sufficient ? " </s>
<s> he shook his head . </s>
<s> " we must go , " said sir john . </s>
<s> " it shall not be put off when we are so near it . </s>
<s> you can not go to town till tomorrow , brandon , that is all . " </s>
<s> " i wish it could be so easily settled . </s>
<s> but it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day ! " </s>
<s> " if you would but let us know what your business is , " said mrs. jennings , " we might see whether it could be put off or not . " </s>
<s> " you would not be six hours later , " said willoughby , " if you were to defer your journey till our return . " </s>
<s> i can not afford to lose _ one _ hour . " </s>
<s> elinor then heard willoughby say , in a low voice to marianne , " there are some people who can not bear a party of pleasure . </s>
<s> brandon is one of them . </s>
<s> he was afraid of catching cold i dare say , and invented this trick for getting out of it . </s>
<s> i would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing . " </s>
<s> " i have no doubt of it , " replied marianne . </s>
<s> " there is no persuading you to change your mind , brandon , i know of old , " said sir john , " when once you are determined on anything . </s>
<s> but , however , i hope you will think better of it . </s>
<s> consider , here are the two miss careys come over from newton , the three miss dashwoods walked up from the cottage , and mr. willoughby got up two hours before his usual time , on purpose to go to whitwell . " </s>
<s> colonel brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of disappointing the party ; but at the same time declared it to be unavoidable . </s>
<s> well , then , when will you come back again ? " </s>
<s> " i hope we shall see you at barton , " added her ladyship , " as soon as you can conveniently leave town ; and we must put off the party to whitwell till you return . " </s>
<s> " you are very obliging . </s>
<s> but it is so uncertain , when i may have it in my power to return , that i dare not engage for it at all . " </s>
<s> " oh ! he must and shall come back , " cried sir john . </s>
<s> " if he is not here by the end of the week , i shall go after him . " </s>
<s> " ay , so do , sir john , " cried mrs. jennings , " and then perhaps you may find out what his business is . " </s>
<s> " i do not want to pry into other men 's concerns . </s>
<s> i suppose it is something he is ashamed of . " </s>
<s> colonel brandon 's horses were announced . </s>
<s> " you do not go to town on horseback , do you ? " added sir john . </s>
<s> " no . only to honiton . </s>
<s> i shall then go post . " </s>
<s> " well , as you are resolved to go , i wish you a good journey . </s>
<s> but you had better change your mind . " </s>
<s> i assure you it is not in my power . " </s>
<s> he then took leave of the whole party . </s>
<s> " is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter , miss dashwood ? " </s>
<s> i am afraid , none at all . " </s>
<s> " then i must bid you farewell for a longer time than i should wish to do . " </s>
<s> to marianne , he merely bowed and said nothing . </s>
<s> " come colonel , " said mrs. jennings , " before you go , do let us know what you are going about . " </s>
<s> he wished her a good morning , and , attended by sir john , left the room . </s>
<s> the complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto restrained , now burst forth universally ; and they all agreed again and again how provoking it was to be so disappointed . </s>
<s> " i can guess what his business is , however , " said mrs. jennings exultingly . </s>
<s> " can you , ma'am ? " said almost every body . </s>
<s> " yes ; it is about miss williams , i am sure . " </s>
<s> " and who is miss williams ? " asked marianne . </s>
<s> " what ! do not you know who miss williams is ? </s>
<s> i am sure you must have heard of her before . </s>
<s> she is a relation of the colonel 's , my dear ; a very near relation . </s>
<s> we will not say how near , for fear of shocking the young ladies . " </s>
<s> then , lowering her voice a little , she said to elinor , " she is his natural daughter . " </s>
<s> " indeed ! " </s>
<s> " oh , yes ; and as like him as she can stare . </s>
<s> i dare say the colonel will leave her all his fortune . " </s>
<s> when sir john returned , he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event ; concluding however by observing , that as they were all got together , they must do something by way of being happy ; and after some consultation it was agreed , that although happiness could only be enjoyed at whitwell , they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country . </s>
<s> the carriages were then ordered ; willoughby 's was first , and marianne never looked happier than when she got into it . </s>
<s> he drove through the park very fast , and they were soon out of sight ; and nothing more of them was seen till their return , which did not happen till after the return of all the rest . </s>
<s> they both seemed delighted with their drive ; but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes , while the others went on the downs . </s>
<s> it was settled that there should be a dance in the evening , and that every body should be extremely merry all day long . </s>
<s> some more of the careys came to dinner , and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table , which sir john observed with great contentment . </s>
<s> willoughby took his usual place between the two elder miss dashwoods . </s>
<s> mrs. jennings sat on elinor 's right hand ; and they had not been long seated , before she leant behind her and willoughby , and said to marianne , loud enough for them both to hear , " i have found you out in spite of all your tricks . </s>
<s> i know where you spent the morning . " </s>
<s> marianne coloured , and replied very hastily , " where , pray ? " </s>
<s> " did not you know , " said willoughby , " that we had been out in my curricle ? " </s>
<s> " yes , yes , mr. impudence , i know that very well , and i was determined to find out _ where _ you had been to . </s>
<s> i hope you like your house , miss marianne . </s>
<s> it is a very large one , i know ; and when i come to see you , i hope you will have new - furnished it , for it wanted it very much when i was there six years ago . " </s>
<s> marianne turned away in great confusion . </s>
<s> mrs. jennings laughed heartily ; and elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been , she had actually made her own woman enquire of mr. willoughby 's groom ; and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to allenham , and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house . </s>
<s> elinor could hardly believe this to be true , as it seemed very unlikely that willoughby should propose , or marianne consent , to enter the house while mrs. smith was in it , with whom marianne had not the smallest acquaintance . </s>
<s> as soon as they left the dining - room , elinor enquired of her about it ; and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by mrs. jennings was perfectly true . </s>
<s> marianne was quite angry with her for doubting it . </s>
<s> " why should you imagine , elinor , that we did not go there , or that we did not see the house ? </s>
<s> is not it what you have often wished to do yourself ? " </s>
<s> yes , marianne , but i would not go while mrs. smith was there , and with no other companion than mr. willoughby . " </s>
<s> [ illustration : " _ i have found you out in spite of all your tricks . _ " ] </s>
<s> " mr. willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to show that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion . </s>
<s> i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life . " </s>
<s> " i am afraid , " replied elinor , " that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety . " </s>
<s> " on the contrary , nothing can be a stronger proof of it , elinor ; for if there had been any real impropriety in what i did , i should have been sensible of it at the time , for we always know when we are acting wrong , and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure . " </s>
<s> " but , my dear marianne , as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks , do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct ? " </s>
<s> " if the impertinent remarks of mrs. jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct , we are all offending every moment of our lives . </s>
<s> i value not her censure any more than i should do her commendation . </s>
<s> i am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over mrs. smith 's grounds , or in seeing her house . </s>
<s> they will one day be mr. willoughby 's , and-- " </s>
<s> if they were one day to be your own , marianne , you would not be justified in what you have done . " </s>
<s> she blushed at this hint ; but it was even visibly gratifying to her ; and after a ten minutes ' interval of earnest thought , she came to her sister again , and said with great good humour , " perhaps , elinor , it _ was _ rather ill - judged in me to go to allenham ; but mr. willoughby wanted particularly to show me the place ; and it is a charming house , i assure you . </s>
<s> there is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs ; of a nice comfortable size for constant use , and with modern furniture it would be delightful . </s>
<s> it is a corner room , and has windows on two sides . </s>
<s> on one side you look across the bowling - green , behind the house , to a beautiful hanging wood , and on the other you have a view of the church and village , and , beyond them , of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired . </s>
<s> i did not see it to advantage , for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture ; but if it were newly fitted up -- a couple of hundred pounds , willoughby says , would make it one of the pleasantest summer - rooms in england . " </s>
<s> could elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others , she would have described every room in the house with equal delight . </s>
